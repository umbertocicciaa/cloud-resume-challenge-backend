# cloud-resume-challenge-backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Cloud Resume Challenge. The backend is implemented using GCP services such as Cloud Functions, API Gateway, and Firestore. The main features include:

- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless functions to handle API requests.
- **API Gateway**: To expose the Cloud Functions as RESTful APIs.
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database to store resume views count.
